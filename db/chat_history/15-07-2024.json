Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Word Embeddings**: The model starts by creating a vector representation for each word in your dataset, called a word embedding. This is done using a technique like Word2Vec or GloVe.\n2. **Context Prediction**: Given an input word, the model tries to predict the surrounding words (context) based on their semantic relationships.\n3. **Loss Function**: The predicted context words are compared with the actual context words, and a loss function measures the difference between the two. This helps the model learn to refine its predictions over time.\n4. **Training**: The model is trained on a large corpus of text data, using the input word and surrounding context words as training examples.\n\nBy doing so, the Skip-Gram model captures subtle relationships between words that aren't immediately apparent from their meanings alone. This allows it to generate more accurate recommendations for related content or even complete sentences!\n\nDoes this explanation help you understand how the Skip-Gram model works?"}]
